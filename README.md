##jQuery Zoombox

Zoombox is a flexible, half-modal, half-tooltip plugin.

Out-of-the-box it does very little and relies on the client-coder to do most of the lifting. Like many things in life, you get what you give.

If you are using zoombox and have a feature request or bug report, please file it at the [Issue queue](https://github.com/legworkstudio/jquery-zoombox/issues).

For usage examples checkout the [Wiki](https://github.com/legworkstudio/jquery-zoombox/wiki).
